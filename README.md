# 🧠 Java Practice Plan (7 Days + Interview Problems)

## 🎯 Goal
Build confidence to complete a **1–1.5 hour Java coding test** (Minero Gloster style): clean OOP code, collections, Streams, and problem-solving.

## 🗓️ 7-Day Overview
- **Day 1 – Core Java Basics** → syntax, loops, functions (`day1/`)
- **Day 2 – Arrays & Collections** → arrays, List/Map, sorting (`day2/`)
- **Day 3 – OOP Fundamentals** → classes, inheritance, polymorphism (`day3/`)
- **Day 4 – Streams & Algorithms** → Stream API, lambda, sorting/searching (`day4/`)
- **Day 5 – Exceptions & File I/O** → try-catch, custom exceptions, read/write (`day5/`)
- **Day 6 – Testing & Clean Code** → JUnit, refactor, debugging (`day6/`)
- **Day 7 – Full Simulation & Review** → final project, time-limit practice (`day7/`)

## 📂 Interview Problems
Frequent interview-style tasks in `interview-problems/` (FizzBuzz, Missing Number, Duplicates, Reverse LinkedList, Merge Intervals, Balanced Parentheses, etc.).

## 🔁 Daily Routine
| Time | Task |
|------|------|
| Morning | Repeat 1–2 exercises from previous day |
| Afternoon | Solve 3 new tasks |
| Evening | Review & refine earlier solutions |

## ✅ Topics to Cover
Core Java • OOP • Collections • Streams • Exceptions • File I/O • Testing • Clean Code

## 💡 Tip
On Day 7, redo the final project **without looking at notes** to simulate the real test.
