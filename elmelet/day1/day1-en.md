# Day 1 – Java Fundamentals & Core OOP Concepts

## Key Terms
- **JDK / JRE / JVM** – Roles of the development kit, runtime environment, and virtual machine.
- **Compilation pipeline** – Source → bytecode → JVM execution, Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- **Primitive vs reference types** – Memory layout, default values, autoboxing/unboxing.
- **Control structures** – `if`, `switch`, loops, `break`/`continue`, expression `switch` (Java 14+).
- **Class, object, constructor** – Instantiation, state vs behavior, `this` keyword usage.
- **Encapsulation / Inheritance / Composition** – When and why to use each design approach.
- **Polymorphism** – Method overriding vs overloading, dynamic dispatch.

## Interview Questions
1. What are the differences between the JDK, JRE, and JVM, and when do you use each?

   **Notes:**

2. Explain Java’s pass-by-value semantics. How does it affect object references?

   **Notes:**

3. List the Java primitive types and describe when you would prefer the wrapper classes.

   **Notes:**

4. Distinguish between method overriding and overloading. Provide a practical example.

   **Notes:**

5. In what situations would you favor composition over inheritance?

   **Notes:**

6. Describe the role of a constructor and when you would call `this()` inside it.

   **Notes:**

7. How does the modern (Java 14+) `switch` expression differ from the traditional statement?

   **Notes:**


## Extra Notes / Practice Ideas
- Implement a simple `Person` class that demonstrates encapsulation (private fields, getters/setters).
- Sketch a `Shape` hierarchy and explain how polymorphism appears when calling different `draw()` implementations.
